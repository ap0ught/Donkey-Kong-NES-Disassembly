# Donkey Kong NES Disassembly

A complete disassembly of Donkey Kong for the NES, covering three different versions:
- **Rev 0** (Japanese release)
- **Rev 1** (International/US release)
- **Gamecube** (from Animal Crossing)

This disassembly is fully complete but documentation is still in progress.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [asm6 assembler](https://github.com/freem/asm6f)
- Python 3.x (for graphics extraction)
- Original Donkey Kong ROM file (for graphics extraction)

### Building

1. Extract graphics from your ROM:
   ```bash
   cd misc
   python ExtractGFX.py
   ```

2. Assemble the ROM:
   ```bash
   asm6 DonkeyKongDisassembly.asm DonkeyKong.nes
   ```

3. To build different versions, edit `DonkeyKongDisassembly.asm` and change the `Version` constant:
   ```assembly
   Version = US        ; Options: JP, US, Gamecube (or 0, 1, 2)
   ```

## Features
